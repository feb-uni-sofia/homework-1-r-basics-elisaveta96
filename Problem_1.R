## NOTE: readability: leave some blank linkes between the code to make it more readable

## NOTE: always leave space before and after <-, -, +, *, /. Leave a blank after commas. Leave blanks around 
## <, >, ==, <=, =>, etc.

## At the very least use the automatic prettifier that comes with R-Studio. Select all lines (e.g. with Ctrl-A)
## and select Code => Reformat Code

## Use comments like a), b) to show which part of the problem
## you are referring to with your code

x <- c(4, 1, 1, 4)
y <- c(1, 4)
x - y
## Missing explanation

#
s <- c(x, y)
rep(s, 10)
length(s)
rep(s, each = 3)
seq(7, 21, by=1)
7:21
length(7:21)
